# Part 3: Ethics & Optimization

## 1. Ethical Considerations

### Bias Identification in MNIST Model

#### **Potential Biases:**

**1. Dataset Representation Bias**
- **Issue:** The MNIST dataset consists primarily of handwritten digits from American census forms and high school students
- **Impact:** The model may perform poorly on:
  - Different handwriting styles from other cultures
  - Digits written with different writing instruments
  - Stylized or artistic number representations
  - Digits written by people with motor disabilities
- **Real-world consequence:** A banking app using this model might fail to recognize check amounts written by elderly users or people with Parkinson's disease

**2. Class Imbalance (Minimal but exists)**
- **Issue:** While MNIST is relatively balanced, slight variations exist in digit frequency
- **Impact:** The model might be slightly more confident in predicting frequently occurring digits
- **Example:** If digit '1' appears slightly more often, the model might have a lower threshold for predicting '1', leading to false positives

**3. Quality Bias**
- **Issue:** Training data consists of clear, centered, well-formed digits
- **Impact:** Poor performance on:
  - Blurry or low-quality images
  - Off-center or rotated digits
  - Partially obscured numbers
  - Varying font sizes
- **Real-world consequence:** Mobile check deposit apps might reject valid checks with slightly smudged numbers

**4. Demographic Bias in Data Collection**
- **Issue:** Original MNIST data collected from a specific demographic (US Census Bureau employees and high school students)
- **Impact:** May not generalize well to:
  - International handwriting styles
  - Different age groups (children vs. elderly)
  - Different educational backgrounds

### Bias Identification in Amazon Reviews Model

#### **Potential Biases:**

**1. Language and Cultural Bias**
- **Issue:** spaCy's `en_core_web_sm` model is trained primarily on English text from specific sources
- **Impact:**
  - Poor performance on non-standard English (AAVE, regional dialects)
  - Misclassification of sentiment in different cultural contexts
  - Failure to recognize entities from non-Western brands
- **Example:** A review saying "This product is sick!" (positive slang) might be classified as negative

**2. Sentiment Lexicon Bias**
- **Issue:** Our rule-based approach uses predefined positive/negative word lists
- **Impact:**
  - Sarcasm and irony are completely missed
  - Context-dependent sentiment is ignored
  - Domain-specific terminology may be misclassified
- **Example:** "This camera is insanely good" → "insanely" might be flagged as negative
- **Example:** "Not bad at all" → double negative interpreted as negative

**3. Named Entity Recognition Bias**
- **Issue:** NER models are trained on news articles and web text, favoring certain entity types
- **Impact:**
  - Well-known Western brands (Apple, Samsung) are easily recognized
  - Smaller, international, or emerging brands are missed
  - Product names that don't follow English patterns are ignored
- **Example:** Chinese brand names written in pinyin might not be recognized as organizations

**4. Review Length Bias**
- **Issue:** Sentiment analysis might be influenced by review length
- **Impact:**
  - Longer reviews accumulate more sentiment words, skewing scores
  - Short, direct reviews might be misclassified as neutral
- **Example:** "Amazing!" (very positive) vs. "This product is okay, not great, but not terrible either" (neutral but longer)

**5. Product Category Bias**
- **Issue:** Different product categories have different review patterns
- **Impact:**
  - Electronics reviews are more technical and less emotional
  - Fashion reviews are more subjective and emotional
  - Same sentiment words mean different things in different contexts
- **Example:** "Basic" is negative for fashion but neutral for electronics

**6. Temporal Bias**
- **Issue:** Language and sentiment expressions evolve over time
- **Impact:**
  - Modern slang and expressions might be misunderstood
  - Historical reviews might be interpreted differently
  - Trending topics affect sentiment interpretation

## 2. Mitigation Strategies Using AI Tools

### A. Mitigating MNIST Biases with TensorFlow Tools

#### **1. TensorFlow Fairness Indicators**

```python
# Install Fairness Indicators
pip install tensorflow-model-analysis fairness-indicators

# Example implementation
import tensorflow_model_analysis as tfma
from fairness_indicators import remediation

# Define fairness metrics
eval_config = tfma.EvalConfig(
    model_specs=[tfma.ModelSpec(label_key='digit')],
    metrics_specs=[
        tfma.MetricsSpec(
            metrics=[
                tfma.MetricConfig(class_name='FairnessIndicators',
                    config='{"thresholds": [0.5]}')
            ]
        )
    ],
    slicing_specs=[
        # Slice by data source
        tfma.SlicingSpec(feature_keys=['data_source']),
        # Slice by image quality
        tfma.SlicingSpec(feature_keys=['quality_score']),
    ]
)

# Analyze model fairness across different slices
eval_result = tfma.analyze_model(
    eval_shared_model=eval_shared_model,
    data_location=data_location,
    eval_config=eval_config
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Identifies performance disparities across different data slices
- Visualizes fairness metrics across subgroups
- Helps detect where the model underperforms

#### **2. Data Augmentation to Reduce Bias**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Apply augmentation to increase diversity
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=15,        # Handle rotated digits
    width_shift_range=0.1,    # Handle off-center digits
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    zoom_range=0.1,           # Handle size variations
    shear_range=0.1,          # Handle skewed digits
    brightness_range=[0.7, 1.3]  # Handle quality variations
)

# Generate augmented training data
augmented_generator = datagen.flow(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32)
```

**Benefits:**
- Creates synthetic variations of training data
- Improves model robustness to real-world variations
- Reduces bias toward perfectly centered, clear images

#### **3. Balanced Sampling**

```python
from sklearn.utils import class_weight

# Calculate class weights to handle imbalance
class_weights = class_weight.compute_class_weight(
    'balanced',
    classes=np.unique(y_train),
    y=y_train
)
class_weight_dict = dict(enumerate(class_weights))

# Train with class weights
model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    class_weight=class_weight_dict,  # Prevents bias toward majority class
    epochs=20
)
```

#### **4. Diverse Data Collection**

**Strategy:**
- Collect additional data from diverse sources:
  - Different countries and cultures
  - Various age groups
  - Different writing conditions (pen, pencil, stylus)
  - People with different abilities

**Implementation:**
```python
# Combine MNIST with other digit datasets
# - EMNIST (Extended MNIST with more diverse handwriting)
# - Street View House Numbers (SVHN)
# - Custom collected data from diverse populations
```

---

### B. Mitigating Amazon Reviews Biases with spaCy

#### **1. Custom Rule-Based Systems with Context Awareness**

```python
import spacy
from spacy.matcher import Matcher

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Create matcher for context-aware sentiment
matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)

# Handle negations better
negation_pattern = [
    {"LOWER": {"IN": ["not", "no", "never"]}},
    {"OP": "*", "IS_ALPHA": True, "LENGTH": {"<": 10}},  # Up to N words
    {"LOWER": {"IN": ["bad", "terrible", "awful"]}}
]
matcher.add("NEGATION_POSITIVE", [negation_pattern])

# Handle intensifiers with context
intensifier_pattern = [
    {"LOWER": {"IN": ["very", "extremely", "really"]}},
    {"LOWER": {"IN": ["good", "bad", "great"]}}
]
matcher.add("INTENSIFIED", [intensifier_pattern])

# Handle sarcasm indicators
sarcasm_pattern = [
    {"LOWER": "yeah"},
    {"LOWER": "right"},
    {"OP": "+"},
    {"LOWER": {"IN": ["!", "..."]}}
]
matcher.add("SARCASM", [sarcasm_pattern])

def context_aware_sentiment(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    matches = matcher(doc)
    
    # Adjust sentiment based on patterns
    sentiment_adjustment = 0
    for match_id, start, end in matches:
        if nlp.vocab.strings[match_id] == "NEGATION_POSITIVE":
            sentiment_adjustment += 2  # "not bad" is actually positive
    
    return sentiment_adjustment
```

**Benefits:**
- Handles linguistic nuances like negation and sarcasm
- Context-aware sentiment analysis
- Reduces misclassification from simple word counting

#### **2. Domain-Specific Entity Recognition**

```python
# Train custom NER model for product-specific entities
from spacy.training import Example

# Create training data with product-specific entities
TRAIN_DATA = [
    ("The iPhone 13 Pro Max is amazing", 
     {"entities": [(4, 21, "PRODUCT")]}),
    ("Samsung Galaxy S21 has great features",
     {"entities": [(0, 18, "PRODUCT")]}),
    # Add more training examples...
]

# Fine-tune spaCy NER on product domain
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
ner = nlp.get_pipe("ner")

# Add custom label
ner.add_label("PRODUCT")

# Train the model
optimizer = nlp.resume_training()
for epoch in range(10):
    for text, annotations in TRAIN_DATA:
        example = Example.from_dict(nlp.make_doc(text), annotations)
        nlp.update([example], sgd=optimizer)
```

**Benefits:**
- Recognizes domain-specific products and brands
- Improves entity extraction for niche or international brands
- Reduces bias toward well-known Western brands

#### **3. Multi-Language and Cultural Adaptation**

```python
# Load appropriate language model
nlp_en = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
nlp_es = spacy.load("es_core_news_sm")  # Spanish
nlp_de = spacy.load("de_core_news_sm")  # German

# Detect language and use appropriate model
from langdetect import detect

def process_review_multilingual(text):
    try:
        lang = detect(text)
        if lang == 'es':
            return nlp_es(text)
        elif lang == 'de':
            return nlp_de(text)
        else:
            return nlp_en(text)
    except:
        return nlp_en(text)  # Default to English
```

#### **4. Bias Detection and Monitoring**

```python
# Monitor model performance across different groups
def analyze_bias_metrics(reviews_df):
    """
    Analyze sentiment prediction bias across different dimensions
    """
    bias_report = {}
    
    # 1. Review length bias
    reviews_df['length_category'] = pd.cut(
        reviews_df['review'].str.len(),
        bins=[0, 100, 300, 1000],
        labels=['short', 'medium', 'long']
    )
    
    length_bias = reviews_df.groupby('length_category')['sentiment'].value_counts(normalize=True)
    bias_report['length_bias'] = length_bias
    
    # 2. Product category bias (if available)
    if 'category' in reviews_df.columns:
        category_bias = reviews_df.groupby('category')['sentiment'].value_counts(normalize=True)
        bias_report['category_bias'] = category_bias
    
    # 3. Sentiment score distribution
    bias_report['score_distribution'] = reviews_df.groupby('sentiment')['score'].describe()
    
    return bias_report

# Run bias analysis
bias_metrics = analyze_bias_metrics(df)
print(bias_metrics)
```

## 3. Troubleshooting Challenge: Buggy TensorFlow Code

### Original Buggy Code

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# BUGGY CODE - DO NOT USE
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28)),  # BUG 1
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='sigmoid')  # BUG 2
])

model.compile(
    optimizer='sgd',  # BUG 3
    loss='mean_squared_error',  # BUG 4
    metrics=['accuracy']
)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)  # BUG 5
```

### Bugs Identified and Fixed

#### **Bug 1: Incorrect Input Shape**
**Problem:** CNN expects 3D input (height, width, channels), not 2D
```python
# WRONG
input_shape=(28, 28)

# CORRECT
input_shape=(28, 28, 1)
# Need to reshape data: X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)
```

#### **Bug 2: Wrong Activation Function**
**Problem:** Sigmoid for multi-class classification (should use softmax)
```python
# WRONG
keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='sigmoid')

# CORRECT
keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
```

#### **Bug 3: Suboptimal Optimizer**
**Problem:** SGD without momentum is slow and unstable
```python
# SUBOPTIMAL
optimizer='sgd'

# BETTER
optimizer='adam'
# OR with custom learning rate
optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
```

#### **Bug 4: Incorrect Loss Function**
**Problem:** MSE is for regression, not classification
```python
# WRONG
loss='mean_squared_error'

# CORRECT for one-hot encoded labels
loss='categorical_crossentropy'

# OR for integer labels
loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy'
```

#### **Bug 5: Data Not Preprocessed**
**Problem:** Data not normalized or reshaped
```python
# MISSING PREPROCESSING
# X_train values are in [0, 255] - need normalization
# X_train shape is (60000, 28, 28) - need channel dimension

# CORRECT PREPROCESSING
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1).astype('float32') / 255.0
X_test = X_test.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1).astype('float32') / 255.0

# If using categorical_crossentropy, one-hot encode labels
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, 10)
```

### Complete Fixed Code

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

# Load data
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# FIX: Proper preprocessing
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1).astype('float32') / 255.0
X_test = X_test.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1).astype('float32') / 255.0

# FIX: One-hot encode labels for categorical_crossentropy
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, 10)

# FIX: Proper model architecture
model = keras.Sequential([
    # FIX 1: Correct input shape with channel dimension
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    # FIX 2: Softmax for multi-class classification
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# FIX: Proper compilation
model.compile(
    # FIX 3: Adam optimizer (better than basic SGD)
    optimizer='adam',
    # FIX 4: Categorical crossentropy for multi-class
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)

# FIX 5: Add validation split and proper batch size
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=128,
    validation_split=0.2,
    verbose=1
)

# Evaluate
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy*100:.2f}%")
```

### Additional Improvements

```python
# Add callbacks for better training
early_stopping = keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',
    patience=3,
    restore_best_weights=True
)

reduce_lr = keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau(
    monitor='val_loss',
    factor=0.5,
    patience=2,
    min_lr=0.00001
)

# Add batch normalization for stability
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),  # IMPROVEMENT
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),  # IMPROVEMENT
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),  # IMPROVEMENT
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Train with callbacks
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=128,
    validation_split=0.2,
    callbacks=[early_stopping, reduce_lr],
    verbose=1
)
```
