# Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

## 1. Short Answer Questions

### Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?

**Primary Differences:**

| Aspect | TensorFlow | PyTorch |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Computation Graph** | Static (TF 1.x) / Dynamic (TF 2.x with eager execution) | Dynamic (define-by-run) |
| **Debugging** | More challenging in TF 1.x, improved in TF 2.x | Easier with Python debugging tools |
| **Deployment** | Superior production tools (TF Serving, TF Lite, TF.js) | Growing ecosystem (TorchServe, ONNX) |
| **API Design** | Higher-level Keras API, more abstraction | More Pythonic, intuitive |
| **Community** | Strong industry adoption | Popular in research |

**When to Choose TensorFlow:**
- **Production Deployment**: When you need robust deployment pipelines across multiple platforms (mobile, web, embedded systems)
- **Industry Projects**: Large-scale applications requiring TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for ML pipelines
- **Mobile/Edge Computing**: TensorFlow Lite provides excellent mobile optimization

- **Learning Deep Learning**: More intuitive for beginners due to Pythonic nature
- **Computer Vision/NLP Research**: Strong community support with libraries like torchvision and Hugging Face Transformers

**Practical Example:**
```python
# TensorFlow is better for:
# - Mobile app image classification
# - IoT device deployment
# - Production ML pipelines with TFX

### Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.

**Use Case 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Experimentation**

Jupyter Notebooks excel at interactive data exploration, allowing data scientists to:
- **Visualize data distributions** in real-time with inline plotting
- **Test hypotheses quickly** by running code cells independently
- **Document insights** alongside code using Markdown cells
- **Iterate rapidly** without re-running entire scripts

**Example Scenario:**
A data scientist analyzing customer churn data can:
1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Create visualizations (histograms, correlation matrices)
3. Try different feature engineering approaches
4. Test multiple models interactively
5. Document findings with explanations and charts

**Benefits:**
- Immediate visual feedback
- Non-linear workflow (run cells out of order)
- Easy sharing with stakeholders
- Combines code, output, and narrative

---

**Use Case 2: Model Training, Evaluation, and Reporting**

Jupyter Notebooks serve as comprehensive ML experiment logs:
- **Track model performance** across different hyperparameters
- **Generate visual reports** with confusion matrices, ROC curves
- **Share reproducible results** with team members
- **Create presentation-ready outputs** for stakeholders

**Example Scenario:**
Training a neural network for image classification:
1. Document model architecture with explanations
2. Visualize training/validation loss curves in real-time
3. Display sample predictions with actual images
4. Calculate and present evaluation metrics
5. Export notebook as PDF/HTML for reports

**Benefits:**
- Self-contained experiment documentation
- Version control friendly (with nbdiff tools)
- Easy collaboration via GitHub
- Can be converted to slides for presentations

### Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

**Key Enhancements:**

**1. Linguistic Intelligence:**
- **Basic Python:** String splitting treats text as character sequences
  ```python
  text.split()  # Simple tokenization by whitespace
  ```
- **spaCy:** Understands language structure
  ```python
  doc = nlp("Dr. Smith earned $1.5M in 2023.")
  # Correctly tokenizes "Dr.", "$1.5M" as single units
  ```

**2. Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
- **Basic Python:** Cannot identify entities without complex regex patterns
- **spaCy:** Pre-trained models recognize people, organizations, locations, dates, money
  ```python
  for ent in doc.ents:
      print(ent.text, ent.label_)  # "Dr. Smith" → PERSON
  ```

**3. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:**
- **Basic Python:** No grammatical understanding
- **spaCy:** Identifies nouns, verbs, adjectives
  ```python
  for token in doc:
      print(token.text, token.pos_)  # "running" → VERB
  ```

**4. Dependency Parsing:**
- **Basic Python:** Cannot understand relationships between words
- **spaCy:** Maps syntactic relationships
  ```python
  for token in doc:
      print(token.text, token.dep_, token.head.text)
      # Shows subject-verb-object relationships
  ```

**5. Lemmatization:**
- **Basic Python:** No word normalization
- **spaCy:** Reduces words to base forms intelligently
  ```python
  "running" → "run", "better" → "good"
  ```

**6. Performance:**
- **Basic Python:** Slow for complex text processing
- **spaCy:** Optimized Cython implementation (up to 100x faster)

**Practical Comparison:**

```python
# Basic Python approach (limited):
text = "Apple Inc. is buying UK startup for $1 billion"
words = text.split()
# Result: ['Apple', 'Inc.', 'is', 'buying', 'UK', 'startup', 'for', '$1', 'billion']
# Cannot identify: Apple Inc. (ORG), UK (GPE), $1 billion (MONEY)

# spaCy approach (intelligent):
doc = nlp(text)
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
# Result:
# Apple Inc. → ORG
# UK → GPE
# $1 billion → MONEY
```

**Use Cases Where spaCy Shines:**
- Information extraction from documents
- Chatbot intent recognition
- Resume parsing
- Medical text analysis
- Legal document processing
- Social media sentiment analysis
